# 8 Joins

A _**Referencing Object Map**_ (`rml:ReferencingObjectMap`) allows
using the subjects (`rml:SubjectMap`) of another triples map (`rml:TriplesMap`)
as the objects generated by a predicate-object map (`rml:PredicateObjectMap`).
Since both triples maps (`rml:TriplesMap`) may be based on
different logical sources (`rml:LogicalSource`),
this may require a join between the logical sources (`rml:LogicalSource`).
This is not restricted to 1:1 joins.

A [Referencing Object Map] is represented by a resource that:

* has exactly one [Parent Triples Map]() (`rr:parentTriplesMap`) property,
whose value MUST be a Triples Map (`rml:TriplesMap`),
known as the [Referencing Object Map]()'s [Parent Triples Map]().
* MAY have one or more [Join Conditions]()  (`rml:joinCondition`) properties.

A [Join Condition]() is represented by a resource that
has exactly one value for each of the following two properties:

* a [child]() (`rml:child`),
whose value is known as the join condition's child reference and
MUST be a references that exists in the [Logical Source]()
of the [Triples Map]() that contains the [Referencing Object Map]()
* a [parent] (`rml:parent`),
whose value is known as the join condition's parent reference and
MUST be a reference that exists in the [Logical Source]()
of the [Referencing Object Map]()'s [Parent Triples Map]().

The [child]() of a [Referencing Object Map]()
is the reference of the [Logical Source]() of the [Term Map]()
containing the [Referencing Object Map](). 
In this case, 
the [Triples Map]() of this [Referencing Object Map]()
is the [Child Triples Map]().

The [parent]() of a [Referencing Object Map]()
is the reference of the [Logical Source]() of its [Parent Triples Map]().
