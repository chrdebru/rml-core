<dfn>Cartesian product</dfn>

Given set `A` and `B`, [=Cartesian product=] of set `A` and `B`, denoted `A Ã— B`, is defined as the set of all ordered pairs `(x, y)` such that `x` belongs to `A` and `y` belongs to `B`.<br>
For example, if `A = {1, 2}` and `B = {a, b, c}`, then the Cartesian Product of A and B is `{(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}`.
